# Reddit-Meme-Download
Program to download picture posts from Reddit fast (implemented without the API). Works best with picture (not comment) focussed subreddits like r/memes.

Simply run the program like any other python script, and enter the subreddit you want to download from when prompted, and the number of pages of data you want to scrape. If prompted, enter the absolute directory of the chromedriver exec application. The program will create new folders for each of the subreddits you access.

# Dependencies
You will need to run two commands if you don't have urllib or selenium:

pip install urllib.request

and 

pip install selenium

The rest of the dependencies will come if you clone the repository.
